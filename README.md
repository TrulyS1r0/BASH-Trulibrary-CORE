# BASH Trulibrary CORE
The core and code library for most of my BASH projects.
To use my scripts on Windows, You need WSL 2 and a supported distribution (Mostly DEBIAN, Preferably Kali Linux). And other dependecies INSIDE OF WSL 2 DISTRIBUTIONS depending on what the software says in the readme. This software is REQUIRED to use most of my scripts, Due to it calling functions otherwise UNKNOWN to the software, Causing errors.

Trulibrary is NOT RESPONSIBLE for any damage done to your computer, By running scripts from other users, That arent on my GitHub, Or Kuratos's (The orginization) which is found at https://github.com/Kuratos-Software. V1.2 and below will have partially and not securely locked script running, Since im currently developing the core, not the scripts. so dont download any Trulibrary scripts until V1.2 is out. And never download things that claim to be Trulibrary that arent on my (Or again, Kuratos-Software's) GitHub page. Stay safe everybody!

# ERROR CODES
Code 41: CALLEDBY is blacklisted
Code 42: CALLEDBY is blacklisted (Verified)

# ERROR CODE EXPLANATIONS
Code 41: The script's CALLEDBY code is blacklisted by the user of Trulibrary, And wont start until removed. A blacklisted CALLEDBY could be because the user knows that a certain CALLEDBY is from a unsafe script.
Code 42: The script's CALLEDBY code is blacklisted by the owner/admins of Trulibrary, And wont start until removed, Which isnt a good idea. A blacklisted CALLEDBY could be because we know that a certain CALLEDBY is from a unsafe script.
