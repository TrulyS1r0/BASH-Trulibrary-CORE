# BASH-Trulibrary-CORE
 The core and code library for most of my BASH projects.
 To use my scripts on Windows, You need WSL 2 and a supported distribution. (Mostly DEBIAN, Preferably Kali Linux) with Zenity installed, And others depending on what the software says in the readme. This software is REQUIRED to use most of my scripts, Due to it calling functions otherwise UNKNOWN to the software, Causing errors.
